        <p>
            I work at the University of Chicago Press within the Journals Subscription Fulfillment group. In my role as Customer Communications and Quality Control Coordinator, I design queries to check the accuracy of our subscription data. I also reach out to institutional and individual subscribers to ensure that they continue their subscriptions with us year after year. It's always best when someone renews.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also serve as an administrator for our group's Salesforce instance. This position has given me the chance to develop on the Salesforce platform. I find few things as engrossing as taking on a programming task: I get excited about focusing on a challenge, and I love having the chance to act on inspiration that comes in the middle of the night.

            Incidentally, the middle of the night is when my cat wants his breakfast. He's lucky that he's otherwise adorable.
